## **Challenges**

I haven't worked on angular for about 6 years, so setting up the initial project and familiarizing myself again with the tooling, structure and syntax took about 3 hours. The rest of the UI was very self explanatory, so no worries there.

## **Improvements**

- Intergrate with a restful api.
- Add Authentication
- Add file export options for Grids
- Add Historical Payslip Data as well as IRP5 PDF/CSV downloads
- Make use of some data analytics service for dashboard charts

## **Total Time Spent**

5.2 hours
