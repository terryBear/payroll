## **How to run the Project**

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.5.

### Development server

for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## **Challenges**

I haven't worked on angular for about 6 years, so setting up the initial project and familiarizing myself again with the tooling, structure and syntax took about 3 hours. The rest of the UI was very self explanatory, so no worries there.

## **Improvements**

- Intergrate with a restful api.
- Add Authentication
- Add file export options for Grids
- Add Historical Payslip Data as well as IRP5 PDF/CSV downloads
- Make use of some data analytics service like Power BI, Tableau, Google Analytics or MongoDB App Service for dashboard charts
- Make application mobile responsive to cater for all screen sizes

## **Total Time Spent**

5.2 hours
